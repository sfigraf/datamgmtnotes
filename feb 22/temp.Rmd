Hello World!

Below is a very pretty graph

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
flights %>%
  group_by(origin) %>%
  summarize(avg.flight.time = mean(air_time,
                                   na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(origin,
                         avg.flight.time),
             y = avg.flight.time)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",
           aes(fill = origin)) +
  xlab("Origin")

```
